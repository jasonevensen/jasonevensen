# Hey, I'm Jason 👋

I'm a programmer, builder, and longtime CNC machinist exploring the world of Linux, automation, and self-hosted systems.

I’ve spent years writing logic-driven code for machines — now I’m bringing that same mindset to scripting, system security, and backend development. I write clean code, build resilient systems, and break things on purpose so I can learn how they really work.

## Current Focus

- Building a hardened Gentoo-based home server
- Writing Bash scripts to automate my workflow
- Exploring system-level programming in C
- Self-hosting tools like Vaultwarden, Jellyfin, and WireGuard
- Documenting everything over at [Packets & Code](https://packetsandcode.com)
