# Hey, I'm Jason 👋

I'm a programmer, builder, and longtime CNC machinist exploring the world of software, Linux, and secure systems. I come from a background in high-precision tooling, but these days you'll find me in the terminal — writing scripts, learning C, hardening servers, and breaking things to understand them better.

## 🚀 Projects & Tools

🔧 **[rsync-usb-backup](https://github.com/jasonevensen/rsync-usb-backup)** – A work-in-progress Bash script that mounts an encrypted USB drive and runs a secure, incremental rsync backup.  
🛠️ **Home Server Build** – Hardened Gentoo server with encrypted storage, self-hosted apps, and YubiKey SSH.  
📓 **[Packets & Code](https://packetsandcode.com)** – My blog/lab notebook documenting experiments in Linux, scripting, self-hosting, and full-stack development.
